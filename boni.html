        <h2>We can see in this carousel in the first picutere this is my account before i started playing this game. and at first it is hard especially i played before in pc's not in smart phones. time in time is i see myself improving by playing everday. and this is the beggining of my fashion or journey in this game.
            and the second picture is this is the time we joined tournament in our municipality of cordova and this is the season 1 btw. about our joruney in this tournament we totally faced different players with there teams and unfortunately we only the 5ft placer it because of some reasons especially about financial support.
            we played with an empty stomach so that it is one reason why we can't achieve being a champion but it's all worth it beacause experience is the key to be better.
            and the last picture of this carousel is we can see this is my account now look at the difference between before and that picture look at the improvement of may rank. all those experience i gained everyday playing solo helps me to be me.
